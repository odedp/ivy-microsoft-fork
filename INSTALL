Overview (see below for detailed installation instructions for Ubuntu, OSX and Windows):

To run ivy, you need:
Firefox 44 or higher
Python 2.7
IPython 3.2.1 (not 4.x), including notebook. The command "ipython notebook" should work.
ply -Python Lex Yacc. The python command "import ply" should work.
Z3 python interface. The python command "import z3" should work.
A symbolic link (linux) or directory junction (windows) from ~/.ipython/nbextensions/ivy to ivy/ivy.
External dependencies found at http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~odedp/ivy_lib.zip unzipped to ivy/ivy/lib.

The ivy web based user interface is currently supported only
inFirefox, version 44 or higher.

How to install on Windows:

# Download and install Grahpviz from http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
# Check that dot can be run from the command line:
dot -V # should work

# Get a recent version of Firefox (version 44 or higher).

# Get Python 2.7 and pip (pip is shipped with Python 2.7.11)
# A good way to get this on Windows is using Anaconda: http://continuum.io/downloads

# Check which version of IPython you have (if any)
ipython --version
# if you have Anaconda with IPython other than 3.2.1, then remove it:
conda uninstall ipython
# use pip to install IPython 3.2.1 with IPython notebook
pip install "ipython[all]==3.2.1"

# Check that IPython is installed and the notebook works:
ipython --version # should be 3.2.1
ipython notebook # should start a notebook server and open a browser window

# Check if you can run the python command "import ply", if no, install ply:
# option 1, using pip:
pip install ply
# option 2, using conda install:
conda install ply
# Make sure you can run the python command "import ply"

# Download and Z3 from https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases and unzip to Z3DIR
# Add Z3DIR/bin to the environment variable PYTHONPATH (and possibly PATH to access z3 from command line)
# Check that you can run the python command "import z3"

# Clone the ivy repository (assuming you clone to BASEDIR\ivy)
git clone -b automation https://github.com/odedp/ivy.git
# Create a directory junction to IPython nbextensions directory
mklink /J %USERPROFILE%\.ipython\nbextensions\ivy BASEDIR\ivy\ivy
# Download ivy external dependencies from http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~odedp/ivy_lib.zip
# and unsip. Rename the ivy_lib directory to BASEDIR\ivy\ivy\lib.

# Run ivy:
cd BASEDIR\ivy\examples\pldi16
python ..\..\ivy\ivy2.py leader_election_ring.ivy # should start a browser window with the leader election example
